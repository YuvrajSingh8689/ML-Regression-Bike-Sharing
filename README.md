# ML-Regression-Bike-Sharing
This repository analyzes bike sharing data using regression analysis techniques to predict bike rental numbers. It includes features EDA, data preprocessing, VIF calculation, regression models, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics like MSE, RMSE, and R-squared. It also handles missing values, categorical variables, and seasonal factors.

Bike Sharing Regression Analysis Overview

• Utilizes regression analysis to predict bike rental numbers.
• Features Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for variable distribution and relationships.
• Data Preprocessing for handling missing values and scaling features.
• Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) calculation for multicollinearity mitigation.
• Regression Models: linear, ridge, lasso, and random forest models.
• Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV for optimal model parameters.
• Evaluation Metrics: MSE, RMSE, and R-squared for model performance.
